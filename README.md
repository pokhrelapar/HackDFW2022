## Inspiration
We all enjoy choose-your-own adventures games and thought it would be a great way to build something fun that's also useful for first time homebuyers.

## What it does
The game simulates 10 years with State Farm as your home insurance provider. You will experience hardship, triumph, and everything in between. 

## How we built it
We used React and CSS Bootstrap to build the dynamically loaded front end of the game, Flask and Axios to form API calls to our backend which was built with Python.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges getting the backend to communicate with the frontend as well as finding ways to make the game more engaging for the user. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the way we were able to utilize out new languages and web frameworks in a short amount of time. 

## What we learned
We learned about Python, initializing a Flask app, React, and UI design theory. 

## What's next for Insurance Game
We want to add more features to increase the number of ways that the user can affect the outcome of the game through things like user inputs.
